some kind of design. currently based on deciphering code >18 months old

Cache:
a basic image cache. tracks tiles/icons/whatever, their names, files and dimensions

Grid:
the map/game display/ui. it displays the map and accepts input to trigger
functions. no game logic

Map:
the power behind the grid. the map knows about the entire game layout, what
terrain/item/character is in each tile, etc





---------------------------------------------------------
old old notes:

grid can interrogate map for:
 - map size (width,height)
 - location contents
   - terrain type
   - characters
 
map will tell grid about:
 - character movement between two locations
 - character warp (ie scatter after battle)
